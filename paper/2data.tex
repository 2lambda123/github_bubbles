\section{Data selection}
\lb{sec:data}

he main goal of the analysis is a study of a relatively small region $\lesssim 10^\circ$ from the GC for energies $\gtrsim 1$ GeV,
we choose the \Fermi LAT Pass 8 Source class events as our main data sample.
We use 9 years of {\Fermi}-LAT data between August 4, 2008  and August 3, 2017 ({\Fermi} Mission Elapsed Time 239557418\,s--523411376\,s)
with energies between 316 MeV $ = 10^{2.5}$ MeV
and 1 TeV separated in 21 logarithmic energy bins (6 bins per decade).
We use the standard quality cuts 
To avoid contamination from cosmic ray interactions in the Earth atmosphere, 
we select events with an angle $\theta < 100^{\circ}$ with respect to the local zenith.
This zenith angle cut is sufficient for energies above 316 MeV.
We calculate the exposure and PSF using the standard {\Fermi} LAT Science Tools package version 
10-01-01 available from the {\Fermi} Science Support Center\footnote{\url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/}} 
using the P8R2\_SOURCE\_V6 instrument response functions.
For spatial binning we use HEALPix\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/healpix/}} \citep{2005ApJ...622..759G} scheme with a pixelization of order 7  ($\approx 0\degr\!\!.46$ pixel size).

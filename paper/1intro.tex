\section{Introduction}
\lb{sec:intro}

Discussion of the \Fermi bubbles properties at high latitudes.

Discussion of the models of the bubbles. Motivate the study at low latitudes.

Discuss the previous results -- hints for higher intensity and harder spectrum near the GP,
also the asymmetry with respect to the GC.

Main goal of this paper - analysis of the \Fermi bubbles within $10^\circ$ from the GP.
Especially at high energies.

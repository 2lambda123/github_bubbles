1. 
General question:
I wonder if we should split the current figure 9 into 3 figures:
parametric, IC and pi0 models.

Then each of these models will go into it's own subsection:
4.3 - parametric
4.4 - IC
4.5 - pi0
each subsection will have plots of models with and without cutoff 
plus a shaded region between the min model (95% lower value of energy cutoff).
each subsection will have a table with the parameters.


2. 
Subsection 4.6 (current 4.5) "summary of the spectrum analysis":
find model min and model max for b = (-2, 2) deg l = (0, -10) deg region.
Model min: smallest normalization and cutoff at 95% lower level.
Model max: largest normalization and no cutoff.

Give all parameters of the models (including normalizations) for the gamma-ray spectra
as well as the IC and pi0 models (normalizations as column densities of electrons and protons?).

This would be very useful for people who would like to do modeling of the CR or
find signatures in, e.g., neutrinos.

In particular, I would like to add a plot with a comparison of the intensity inside
b = (-2, 2) l = (0, -10) region with the CTA and KM3NeT sensitivities (in pi0 scenario).
These plot would go at the end of Section 5.1.

Check a few numbers in (current) Tables 1 and 2 (all models b = (-2, 2) both east and west).

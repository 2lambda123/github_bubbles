\section{Conclusions}
We want to estimate the properties that particles need to have to emit the gamma radiation observed in the region $b \in (\ang{-2},\ang{2}),\ \ell \in (\ang{-10},\ang{0})$. Averaged over the ROI, the best-fit spectrum of the electrons shows no cutoff and we conclude, that electrons of at least $E_0 = \SI{1}{TeV}$ need to be able to travel inside the whole volume of the ROI.  We start with a diffusion equation taking into account diffusion and energy loss $b_\IC(E)$ via IC. From the solution we read off the diffusion distance for electrons with energy $E_0 = \SI{1}{TeV}$:
\be
\langle x \rangle^2 = 2 \int_{E_0}^\infty \frac{D(E)}{b_\IC(E)}\de E = \SI{1300}{pc}.
\ee
We assumed a spatially constant diffusion coefficient $D(E) = D_0\left(\frac{E}{\SI{1}{GeV}}\right)^\delta$ with values of the local diffusion coefficient $D_0 = \SI{3e28}{cm^2/s} = \SI{100}{pc^2/kyr}$ and $\delta = 0.4$. The energy loss $b_\IC(E)$ is \dots.\\
Assuming a distance of $\SI{8}{kpc}$ to the ROI, we find a height of $\SI{0.56}{kpc}$ in latitude and a length of $\SI{0.98}{kpc}$ in longitude. Since the diffusion distance of the electrons exceeds the spatial size of the ROI, the electrons cannot be confined. Therefore, we find that a transient process is favoured. The energy losses of protons exceed the energy losses of electrons by far, therefore the same applies for protons.\\
Wit the local diffusion coefficient we find an escape time for both electrons and protons of 
\be
T = \frac{\Delta x^2}{2 D(E)} = \SI{70}{kyr}.
\ee

The total energy density in electrons with energy above $E_0 = \SI{1}{GeV}$, which needs to be generated by this transient process, is given by the integral of the electron spectrum that was found in Section \ref{sec:IC_model}:

\be
\frac{\de E_\tot}{\de V} = \int_{E_0}^{\infty} \left(E \frac{\de N}{\de E}\right)_{\!\!\el} \de E = \SI{4.9}{meV/cm^3}.
\ee
Assuming that the depth along the optical axis coincides with the length in longitude, the volume of the ROI is $V = \SI{0.54}{kpc^3} = \SI{1.58e64}{cm^3}$. The total energy content of the ROI in electrons above $\SI{1}{GeV}$ is $E_\tot = \SI{8e61}{eV} = \SI{1e50}{erg}$, which corresponds to the CR energy output of $10$ SNe.\\
Using the result from Section \ref{sec:Pion_model} we find an energy density in protons of $\de E_\tot / \de V = \SI{84}{meV/cm^3}$ and a total energy content of $E_\tot = \SI{1e63}{eV} = \SI{2e51}{erg}$. However, the gas density in the inner Galaxy is probably higher than $n_\Hy = \SI{1}{/cm^3}$ as assumed in Section \ref{sec:Pion_model}, resulting in an energy content in protons of the same order of magnitude as the energy density in electrons. \\

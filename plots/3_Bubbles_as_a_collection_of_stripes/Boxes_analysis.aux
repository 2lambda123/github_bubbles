The box parameter is the fitting parameter of the rectangle. The rectangles are $4^\circ $ in latitude and $10^\circ $ (top row) or $16^\circ $ in longitude (bottom row). The rectangles west and east have been fitted independently. Point sources have been masked with the $0.5^\circ $ mask and the mask has been (point-)symmetrized (w.r.t. the GC). The high-energy data has been smoothed with a Gaussian of $0.5^\circ $ FWHM to compensate for the worse resolution at low energies. Only data with $|\ell | < 90^\circ $ is taken into account.\relax }}{1}}

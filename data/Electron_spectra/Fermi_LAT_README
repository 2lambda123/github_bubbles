********************************************************************************

File: CREtable_LE.txt (Table 1):

Description: Number of events after background subtraction (without correction for the loss of CREs above the geomagnetic energy cutooff), residual background contamination and flux J_E, with its statistical and systematic errors, for the LE selection.

column 1: E_low (GeV)
column 2: E_up (GeV)
column 3: counts
column 4: contamination
column 5: flux J_E (GeV^-1 s^-1 m^-2 sr^-1)
column 6: statistical error (fractional value)
column 7: systematic error (fractional value)

********************************************************************************

File: CREtable_HE.txt (Table 2):

Description: Number of events after background subtraction, residual background contamination and flux J_E , with its statistical and systematic errors (the acceptance uncertainty and the sum of the contamination and IVC correction uncertainties are shown separately), for the HE selection.

column 1: E_low (GeV)
column 2: E_up (GeV)
column 3: counts
column 4: contamination
column 5: flux J_E (GeV^-1 s^-1 m^-2 sr^-1)
column 6: statistical error (fractional value)
column 7: systematic error due to acceptance uncertainty (fractional value)
column 8: systematic error due to contamination + IVC correction uncertainties (fractional value)

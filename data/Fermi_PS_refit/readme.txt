This folder contains the results of an all sky analysis of the Fermi LAT data
8 years of Pass 8 Source, z = 100 zenith angle cut
we use energies between 30 MeV and 600 GeV in the analysis (28 energy bins)

3FGL PS are represented as a single template (in each energy bin)
cores of 200 brightest 3FGL PS outside of R = 10 deg radius are masked
40 PS with largest flux above 10 GeV are refitted in each energy bin independently

Residual with added GC excess model (gNFW template) and high latitude bubbles in healpix format

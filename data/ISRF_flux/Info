The file `Standard.dat' provides a basic (ASCII) directory structure that is read by GALPROP. Each part of this, e.g., Standard_X_Y_Z_(name)_HP.fits.gz gives certain components of the ISRF at the (X,Y,Z) location (in kpc). The important files for IC losses are the Standard_X_Y_Z_Total_HP.fits.gz and Standard_X_Y_Z_Flux.fits.gz -- these give the intensity and integrated flux as a function of frequency at the location X,Y,Z, respectively. GALPROP simply reads in the sampled ISRF and bi-linearly interpolates (for 2D) to give the ISRF for a location that is not at one of the sampled grid points. There is no `simple' file like the earlier versions because of the additional angular information, and break down into different components (I can provide a description of what the different components are for, but this is only of interest if you want to use them for studies unrelated to calculating total IC emission/energy losses).
